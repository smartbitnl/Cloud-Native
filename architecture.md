##Why Docker Machine and OpenStack?
Some readers may be wondering why one might use Docker Machine in an OpenStack environment. After all, doesn’t Docker make OpenStack obsolete? (That was sarcasm, in case you didn’t notice.)

Here’s my line of thinking. OpenStack is really more of an infrastructure orchestration tool, designed for provisioning infrastructure (VMs, volumes, networks, routers, etc.). Will it evolve over time to be more “application-aware”? Probably, but that’s not where it is today. Docker, on the other hand, is more an an application provisioning tool, designed to simplify how developers, operators, and organizations deploy applications. Will it evolve over time to be more involved in infrastructure? Most likely, but that’s not really where its strengths are found today. Docker needs infrastructure, and OpenStack supplies infrastructure. By combining Docker Machine and OpenStack, you create what is (in my opinion) a nice “consumer/provider” relationship between OpenStack (which provides infrastructure) and Docker (which consumes infrastructure to deploy applications).
